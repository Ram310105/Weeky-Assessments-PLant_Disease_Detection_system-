project:Plant disease detection system for sustainable agriculture

This project builds a CNN-based model to identify diseases in plant leaves using images. It classifies leaves from crops like apple 🍎, cherry 🍒, grape 🍇, and corn 🌽 as healthy or infected. The system helps 👨‍🌾 farmers detect diseases early, enabling faster action and sustainable farming.
